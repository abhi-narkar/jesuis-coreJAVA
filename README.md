# jesuis-coreJAVA
The Project is the final project presented for the Fundamental semester students of the Java Fundamentals class.
This project is the implementation of an Identity Management Software. The project was partially developed during the semester’s class and has been completed during the last week during the end of the semester.
The implementation of this project has been done by command line only, no UI is provided.

The IAMCORE Project has 4 major features.
•	Authentication: A User should be authenticated before been able to work and manage the Identities.
•	Manage Identities: the user should be able to 
o	Create, 
o	Update,
o	Delete
o	Search Identities from the application.

To do this, the Identities and the users are stored as application data. We use Derby as the Database engine for managing the entities.
